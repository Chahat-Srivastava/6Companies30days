## Question : Maximum Sum BST

### Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Code (Python):
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxSumBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        res = 0
        def traverse(root):
            '''return status_of_bst, size_of_bst, left_bound, right_bound'''
            nonlocal res
            if not root: return 1, 0, None, None # this subtree is empty
            
            ls, l, ll, lr = traverse(root.left)
            rs, r, rl, rr = traverse(root.right)
            
            if ((ls == 2 and lr < root.val) or ls == 1) and ((rs == 2 and rl > root.val) or rs == 1):
		        # this subtree is a BST
                size = root.val + l + r
                res = max(res, size)
                return 2, size, (ll if ll is not None else root.val), (rr if rr is not None else root.val)
            return 0, None, None, None # this subtree is not a BST
        
        traverse(root)
        return res
